# A Github Finder App


## What it does
An app built with React an Github API with a purpose of searching and displaying data of user's profiles.


## How it works 
- Fetching users from Github with API.
- Displaying a grid of users based on a search query.
- Showing aditional data of a certain user.

Not the most exciting application, but it is what it is...
